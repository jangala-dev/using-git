# Using git and Github

This repository is Jangala's guide to effectively using git and Github. In here you'll find examples and guides on how to effectively use these tools.

## Markdown

The best way to keep text and descriptions in git is using the Markdown format. Markdown is a plain text format for representing rich text, you can find out more about Markdown [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). Github's own guide to Markdown is great and you can find it [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

## Web editor vs VSCode

Although you can use the web editor to make changes it's much easier to use a text editor like VSCode. You can download git and VSCode by doing following the guides below.

### Mac using Homebrew (preferred)

On a Mac enter the following in Terminal, line by line preferably:
```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
brew install --cask visual-studio-code
brew install git
```

### Windows by installing packages

Download and install [Git](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.36.1.windows.1/Git-2.36.1-64-bit.exe)

Then download and install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/?dv=win#:~:text=direct%20download%20link.)
